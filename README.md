# CIS244 Project

Dear CIS244 Students,
As we gear up for another impactful semester, I wanted to share some insights into one of our
course's cornerstones â€“ the semester-long Java project. It is more than just an academic
exercise; it's an invaluable experience that bridges theory and practice.\
<br>
**This is a hands-on project:**
1. Reinforces Design Principles: Concepts learned in lectures come alive when applied to
real-world scenarios, deepening understanding of design patterns, architecture, and
user experience.
2. Promotes Problem Solving: Tackling real-world challenges fosters critical thinking,
adaptability, and innovative problem-solving skills.
3. Encourages Collaboration: Team projects mimic industry settings, cultivating skills in
teamwork, communication, and conflict resolution.
4. Prepares for Industry: By working on an end-to-end project, students get a feel for the
software development lifecycle, making the transition from academia to industry
smoother.
5. Boosts Confidence: Completing a project from conception to deployment instills a sense
of achievement, building confidence in one's abilities to craft meaningful software
solutions.
Investing time and effort in a semester-long Java project is not just about earning grades; it's
about shaping future-ready software professionals.
I encourage each of you to embrace this project with enthusiasm and an open mind.
Remember, the skills and experiences you gain here are foundational stepping stones for your
career ahead.\

Semester-Long Software Development Project: \
Title:
<br>
Objective: \
To design and implement a software solution that enables users to create, manage, draw
insights, (fill in more what your project can do), and assess the feasibility of a desktop
application. The project will focus on principles of software design, architectural patterns, user
experience, security best practices, database management, object-oriented programming and
others.
<br>
Details: 
1. Business Proof of Concept:
- Problem Statement: (What project can do). An intuitive, modern software
solution can enhance operational efficiency and user experience.
- Target Market: (Your end-users and target customers)
- Unique Selling Proposition: (Business Proposition), and cost-effective.
2. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):
- Development Costs: Salaries for developers, cost of training (if required), and
software licenses.
- Operational Costs: Hosting the database, ongoing software maintenance, and
support.
- Deployment Costs: Training for users, support staff, hardware (if not already
available), and potential costs related to data migration.
- Update & Upgrade Costs: Periodic software updates to add new features,
improve existing ones, or fix bugs.
- End of Life Costs: Data backup and migration to a new system (if needed).
3. Requirements Gathering and Specification:
- Understand the daily operations of (Your group project).
- Design an intuitive interface.
- Identify user roles (Admin, staff, user, etc.).
4. Tools and Technologies:
- Language: Java and other languages
- GUI: JavaFX
- Database: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, GCP BQ, or others
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
5. Stages of the Project:
1. Stage 1: Market Research & Mockups
- Conduct surveys with stake-holders to refine the problem statement and
understand their pain points.
- Design the layouts and UIs with Wireframe tool.
